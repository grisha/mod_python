This directory contains the mod_python documentation sources.

If you're looking for documentation, go to the ../doc-html
directory, or http://www.modpython.org/. 

This directory is mainly for LaTeX geeks.

In order for anything here to be functional, you must have
configured mod_python with the --with-python option.

You also need to have all the necessary tools installed, see
"Documenting Python" by Fred L. Drake.

If everything is in place, you should be able to generate PDF,
HTML, DVI as well as Postscript file by simply typing one
of the following commands:

make pdf
make html
make dvi
make ps

Good Luck!


LaTeX Notes
-----------

Using the tilde character in LaTex is a bit of a headache as ~ is used for
markup.

The obvious solution of escaping it as \~ doesn't work, as this is also used
for markup and actually adds a diactrical to the immediately following 
character.

If you want a ~ enclosed in double quotes you can use \character{\~}.
So \character{\~} becomes "~" in the generated documentation.

If you want a ~ without the quotes you can use \textasciitilde.
For example ~/foo/bar should be written as \textasciitilde/foo/bar in the
LaTeX source.

Using \textasciitilde does not work if there is an alpha-numeric character 
immediately following. For a url you can hex encode the ~ as %7e. For example:
	http://people.apache.org/~jgallacher
should be written as:
	http://people.apache.org/\%7ejgallacher

Note that the ~ character is handled properly within a {verbatim} section,
so the following works without modification:

  \begin{verbatim}
	path = "~/foo/bar"
  \end{verbatim}
