The following is a list of people who have contributed to the
development of mod_python. 

Anyone who has contributed code or otherwise made contributions that
were constructive to the development of the project may have his name
listed here. Note that the decision on whether a name goes on this
list or not is initially taken by me (grisha@ispol.com) and that I can
be wrong.  So if you feel that you should be credited as well, or if
you feel that you should not be listed, please e-mail me.

The names are listed alphabetically by last name.
