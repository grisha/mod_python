\section{Multiple Interpreters\label{pyapi-interps}}
      
When working with mod_python, it is important to be aware of a feature
of Python that is normally not used when using the language for
writing scripts to be run from command line. This feature is not
available from within Python itself and can only be accessed through
the \citetitle[http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/api.html]{C
language API}.

Python C API provides the ability to create \dfn{subinterpreters}. A
more detailed description of a subinterpreter is given in the
documentation for the
\citetitle[http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/initialization.html]{\cfunction{Py_NewInterpreter()}}
function. For this discussion, it will suffice to say that each
subinterpreter has its own separate namespace, not accessible from
other subinterpreters. Subinterpreters are very useful to make sure
that separate programs running under the same Apache server do not
interfere with one another.

At server start-up or mod_python initialization time, mod_python
initializes an interpreter called \dfn{main} interpreter.  The main
interpreter contains a dictionary of subinterpreters. Initially, this
dictionary is empty. With every request, as needed, subinterpreters
are created, and references to them are stored in this dictionary. The
dictionary is keyed on a string, also known as \emph{interpreter
name}. This name can be any string.  The main interpreter is named
\samp{main_interpreter}.  The way all other interpreters are named can
be controlled by \code{PythonInterp*} directives. Default behaviour is
to name interpreters using the Apache virtual server name
(\code{ServerName} directive). This means that all scripts in the same
vrtual server execute in the same subinterpreter, but scripts in
different virtual servers execute in different subinterpreters with
completely separate namespaces.
\citetitle[dir-other-ipd.html]{\code{PythonInterpPerDirectory}} and
\citetitle[dir-other-ipdv.html]{\code{PythonInterpPerDirective}}
directives alter the naming convention to use the absolute path of the
directory being accessed, or the directory in which the
\code{Python*Handler} was encountered, respectively.
\citetitle[dir-other-pi.html]{\code{PythonInterpreter}} can be used to
force the interpreter name to a specific string overriding any naming
conventions.

Once created, a subinterpreter will be reused for subsequent requests.
It is never destroyed and exists until the Apache process dies.

You can find out the name of the interpreter under which you're
running by peeking at \member{req.interpreter}.

\section{Overview of a Request Handler\label{pyapi-handler}}
\indexii{request}{handler}

A \dfn{handler} is a function that processes a particular phase of a
request. Apache processes requests in phases - read the request,
process headers, provide content, etc. For every phase, it will call
handlers, provided by either the Apache core or one of its modules,
such as mod_python which passes control to functions provided by the
user and written in Python. A handler written in Python is not any
different from a handler written in C, and follows these rules:

\index{req} \indexii{request}{object} A handler function will always
be passed a reference to a request object. (Throughout this manual,
the request object is often referred to by the \code{req} variable.)

Every handler can return:

\begin{itemize}

\item
\constant{apache.OK}, meaning this phase of the request was handled by this 
handler and no errors occurred. 

\item
\constant{apache.DECLINED}, meaning this handler has not handled this
phase of the request to completion and Apache needs to look for
another handler in subsequent modules.
 
\item
\constant{apache.\emph{HTTP_ERROR}}, meaning an HTTP error occurred. 
\var{HTTP_ERROR} can be any of the following:

\begin{verbatim}
HTTP_CONTINUE                     = 100
HTTP_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS          = 101
HTTP_PROCESSING                   = 102
HTTP_OK                           = 200

HTTP_PARTIAL_CONTENT              = 206
HTTP_MULTI_STATUS                 = 207
HTTP_MULTIPLE_CHOICES             = 300
HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY            = 301
HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY            = 302
HTTP_SEE_OTHER                    = 303
HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED                 = 304
HTTP_USE_PROXY                    = 305
HTTP_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT           = 307
HTTP_BAD_REQUEST                  = 400
HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED                 = 401
HTTP_PAYMENT_REQUIRED             = 402
HTTP_FORBIDDEN                    = 403
HTTP_NOT_FOUND                    = 404
HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED           = 405
HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE               = 406
HTTP_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED= 407
HTTP_REQUEST_TIME_OUT             = 408

HTTP_PRECONDITION_FAILED          = 412
HTTP_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE     = 413
HTTP_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LARGE        = 414
HTTP_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE       = 415
HTTP_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE        = 416
HTTP_EXPECTATION_FAILED           = 417
HTTP_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY         = 422
HTTP_LOCKED                       = 423
HTTP_FAILED_DEPENDENCY            = 424
HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR        = 500
HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED              = 501
HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY                  = 502
HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE          = 503
HTTP_GATEWAY_TIME_OUT             = 504
HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED        = 505
HTTP_VARIANT_ALSO_VARIES          = 506
HTTP_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE         = 507
HTTP_NOT_EXTENDED                 = 510
\end{verbatim}                      

\end{itemize}

As an alternative to \emph{returning} an HTTP error code, handlers can
signal an error by \emph{raising} the \constant{apache.SERVER_RETURN}
exception, and providing an HTTP error code as the exception value,
e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
raise apache.SERVER_RETURN, apache.HTTP_FORBIDDEN
\end{verbatim}
              
Handlers can send content to the client using the \method{req.write()}
method. 

Client data, such as POST requests, can be read by using the
\method{req.read()} function.

\strong{NOTE:} The directory of the Apache \code{Python*Handler} 
directive in effect is prepended to the \code{sys.path}. If the
directive was specified in a server config file outside any
\code{<Directory>}, then the directory is unknown and not prepended.

An example of a minimalistic handler might be: 

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache

def requesthandler(req):
    req.content_type = "text/plain"
    req.write("Hello World!")
    return apache.OK
\end{verbatim}

\section{Overview of a Filter Handler\label{pyapi-filter}}
\indexii{filter}{handler}

A \dfn{filter handler} is a function that can alter the input or the
output of the server. There are two kinds of filters - \dfn{input} and
\dfn{output} that apply to input from the client and output to the
client respectively.

At this time mod_python supports only request-level filters, meaning
that only the body of HTTP request or response can be filtered. Apache
provides support for connection-level filters, which will be supported
in the future.

A filter handler receives a \emph{filter} object as its argument. The
request object is available as well via \code{filter.req}, but all
writing and reading should be done via the filter's object read and
write methods.

Filters need to be closed when a read operation returns None 
(indicating End-Of-Stream).

The return value of a filter is ignored. Filters cannot decline
processing like handlers, but the same effect can be achieved
by using the \method{filter.pass_on()} method.

Filters must first be registered using \code{PythonInputFilter} or
\code{PythonOutputFilter}, then added using the Apache
\code{Add/SetInputFilter} or \code{Add/SetOutputFilter} directives. 

Here is an example of how to specify an output filter, it tells the
server that all .py files should processed by CAPITALIZE filter:

\begin{verbatim}
  PythonOutputFilter capitalize CAPITALIZE
  AddOutputFilter CAPITALIZE .py
\end{verbatim}

And here is what the code for the \file{capitalize.py} might look
like:

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache

def outputfilter(filter):

    s = filter.read()
    while s:
        filter.write(s.upper())
        s = filter.read()

    if s is None:
        filter.close()

\end{verbatim}

When writing filters, keep in mind that a filter will be called any
time anything upstream requests an IO operation, and the filter has no
control over the amount of data passed through it and no notion of
where in the request processing it is called. For example, within a
single request, a filter may be called once or five times, and there
is no way for the filter to know beforehand that the request is over
and which of calls is last or first for this request, thought
encounter of an EOS (None returned from a read operation) is a fairly
strong indiciation of an end of a request.

Also note that filters may end up being called recursively in
subrequests. To avoid the data being altered more than once, always
make sure you are not in a subrequest by examining the \code{req.main}
value.

For more information on filters, see
\citetitle[http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/developer/filters.html]{http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/developer/filters.html}.

\section{Overview of a Connection Handler\label{pyapi-conn}}
\indexii{connection}{handler}

A \dfn{connection handler} handles the connection, starting almost
immediately from the point the TCP connection to the server was
made. 

Unlike HTTP handlers, connection handlers receive a \emph{connection}
object as an argument.

Connection handlers can be used to implement protocols. Here is an
example of a simple echo server:

Apache configuration:
\begin{verbatim}
    PythonConnectionHandler echo
\end{verbatim}

Contents of \filenq{echo.py} file:

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache

def connectionhandler(conn):

    while 1:
        conn.write(conn.readline())

    return apache.OK
\end{verbatim}

\section{\module{apache} -- Access to Apache Internals.}
\declaremodule[apache]{extension}{apache}
\modulesynopsis{Access to Apache Internals}
\moduleauthor{Gregory Trubetskoy}{grisha@modpython.org}

The Python interface to Apache internals is contained in a module
appropriately named \module{apache}, located inside the
\module{mod_python} package. This module provides some important
objects that map to Apache internal structures, as well as some useful
functions, all documented below. (The request object also provides an
interface to Apache internals, it is covered in its own section of
this manual.)

\indexii{_apache}{module} The \module{apache} module can only be
imported by a script running under mod_python. This is because it
depends on a built-in module \module{_apache} provided by
mod_python.

It is best imported like this:

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache
\end{verbatim}

\module{mod_python.apache} module defines the following functions and
objects. For a more in-depth look at Apache internals, see the
\citetitle[http://httpd.apache.org/dev/]{Apache Developer page}

\subsection{Functions\label{pyapi-apmeth}}

\begin{funcdesc}{log_error}{message\optional{, level, server}}
An interface to the Apache
\citetitle[http://dev.apache.org/apidoc/apidoc_ap_log_error.html]{ap_log_error()}
function. \var{message} is a string with the error message, \var{level} is
one of the following flags constants:

\begin{verbatim}
APLOG_EMERG
APLOG_ALERT
APLOG_CRIT
APLOG_ERR
APLOG_WARNING
APLOG_NOTICE
APLOG_INFO
APLOG_DEBUG
APLOG_NOERRNO
\end{verbatim}            
      
\var{server} is a reference to a \member{req.server} object. If
\var{server} is not specified, then the error will be logged to the
default error log, otherwise it will be written to the error log for
the appropriate virtual server. When \var{server} is not specified,
the setting of LogLevel does not apply, the LogLevel is dictated by
an httpd compile-time default, usually \code{warn}.

If you have a reference to a request object available, consider using
\method{req.log_error} intead, it will prepend request-specific
information such as the source IP of the request to the log entry.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{allow_methods}{\optional{*args}}
A convenience function to set values in \member{req.allowed}.
\member{req.allowed} is a bitmask that is used to construct the
"Allow:" header. It should be set before returning a
\code{HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED} error.

Arguments can be one or more of the following:
\begin{verbatim}
M_GET
M_PUT
M_POST
M_DELETE
M_CONNECT
M_OPTIONS
M_TRACE
M_PATCH
M_PROPFIND
M_PROPPATCH
M_MKCOL
M_COPY
M_MOVE
M_LOCK
M_UNLOCK
M_VERSION_CONTROL
M_CHECKOUT
M_UNCHECKOUT
M_CHECKIN
M_UPDATE
M_LABEL
M_REPORT
M_MKWORKSPACE
M_MKACTIVITY
M_BASELINE_CONTROL
M_MERGE
M_INVALID
\end{verbatim}

\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{config_tree}{}
Returns the server-level configuration tree. This tree does not
include directives from .htaccess files. This is a \emph{copy} of
the tree, modifying it has no effect on the actual configuration.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{server_root}{}
Returns the value of ServerRoot.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{make_table}{} 
This function is obsolete and is an alias to \class{table} (see below).
\end{funcdesc}

\subsection{Table Object (mp_table)\obindex{table}\label{pyapi-mptable}}

\index{table}
\begin{classdesc}{table}{\optional{mapping-or-sequence}}
Returns a new empty object of type \code{mp_table}. See Section
\ref{pyapi-mptable} for description of the table object. The
\var{mapping-or-sequence} will be used to provide initial values for
the table.  

The table object is a wrapper around the Apache APR table. The table
object behaves very much like a dictionary (including the Python 2.2
features such as support of the \code{in} operator, etc.), with the 
following differences:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Both keys and values must be strings.
\item
Key lookups are case-insensitive.
\item
Duplicate keys are allowed (see \method{add()} below). When there is
more than one value for a key, a subscript opration returns a list.
\end{itemize}

Much of the information that Apache uses is stored in tables. For
example, \member{req.headers_in} and \member{req.headers_out}.

All the tables that mod_python provides inside the request
object are actual mappings to the Apache structures, so changing the
Python table also changes the underlying Apache table.

In addition to normal dictionary-like behavior, the table object also
has the following method:

\begin{methoddesc}[table]{add}{key, val}
\function{add()} allows for creating duplicate keys, which is useful 
when multiple headers, such as \code{Set-Cookie:} are required.
\end{methoddesc}

\versionadded{3.0}
\end{classdesc}

\subsection{Request Object\index{request}\label{pyapi-mprequest}}

The request object is a Python mapping to the Apache
\code{request_rec} structure. When a handler is invoked, it is always
passed a single argument - the request object. 

You can dynamically assign attributes to it as a way to communicate
between handlers.

\subsubsection{Request Methods\label{pyapi-mprequest-meth}}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{add_common_vars}{}
Calls the Apache \cfunction{ap_add_common_vars()} function. After a
call to this method, \member{req.subprocess_env} will contain a
lot of CGI information.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{add_handler}{htype, handler\optional{, dir}}

Allows dynamic handler registration. \var{htype} is a string
containing the name of any of the apache request (but not filter or
connection) handler directives,
e.g. \samp{PythonHandler}. \var{handler} is a string containing the
name of the module and the handler function.  Optional \var{dir} is a
string containing the name of the directory to be added to the
pythonpath. If no directory is specified, then, if there is already a
handler of the same type specified, its directory is inherited,
otherwise the directory of the presently executing handler is used.
                  
A handler added this way only persists throughout the life of the
request. It is possible to register more handlers while inside the
handler of the same type. One has to be careful as to not to create an
infinite loop this way.

Dynamic handler registration is a useful technique that allows the
code to dynamically decide what will happen next. A typical example
might be a \code{PythonAuthenHandler} that will assign different
\code{PythonHandlers} based on the authorization level, something like:

\begin{verbatim}
if manager:
    req.add_handler("PythonHandler", "menu::admin")
else:
    req.add_handler("PythonHandler", "menu::basic")
\end{verbatim}                              

Note: There is no checking being done on the validity of the handler
name. If you pass this function an invalid handler it will simply be
ignored.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{allow_methods}{methods\optional{, reset}}
Adds methods to the \member{req.allowed_methods} list. This list
will be passed in \code{Allowed:} header if
\constant{HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED} or \constant{HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED}
is returned to the client. Note that Apache doesn't do anything to
restrict the methods, this list is only used to construct the
header. The actual method-restricting logic has to be provided in the
handler code.

\var{methods} is a sequence of strings. If \var{reset} is 1, then
the list of methods is first cleared.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{document_root}{}
Returns DocumentRoot setting.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{get_basic_auth_pw}{}
Returns a string containing the password when Basic authentication is
used.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{get_config}{}
Returns a reference to the table object containing the mod_python
configuration in effect for this request except for
\code{Python*Handler} and \code{PythonOption} (The latter can be
obtained via \method{req.get_options()}. The table has directives as
keys, and their values, if any, as values.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{get_remote_host}{\optional{type, str_is_ip}}

This method is used to determine remote client's DNS name or IP
number. The first call to this function may entail a DNS look up, but
subsequent calls will use the cached result from the first call.

The optional \var{type} argument can specify the following: 

\begin{itemize}

\item
\code{apache.REMOTE_HOST} Look up the DNS name. Return None if Apache
directive \code{HostNameLookups} is \code{off} or the hostname cannot
be determined.

\item                  
\code{apache.REMOTE_NAME} \emph{(Default)} Return the DNS name if
possible, or the IP (as a string in dotted decimal notation)
otherwise.

\item
\code{apache.REMOTE_NOLOOKUP} Don't perform a DNS lookup, return an
IP. Note: if a lookup was performed prior to this call, then the
cached host name is returned.

\item
\code{apache.REMOTE_DOUBLE_REV} Force a double-reverse lookup. On 
failure, return None.

\end{itemize}

If \var{str_is_ip} is \code{None} or unspecified, then the return
value is a string representing the DNS name or IP address.

If the optional \var{str_is_ip} argument is not \code{None}, then the
return value is an \code{(address, str_is_ip)} tuple, where \var{str_is_ip}
is non-zero if \code{address} is an IP address string.

On failure, \code{None} is returned.

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{get_options}{}
Returns a reference to the table object containing the options set by
the \code{PythonOption} directives.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{internal_redirect}{new_uri}
Internally redirects the request to the \var{new_uri}. \var{new_uri}
must be a string.

The httpd server handles internal redirection by creating a new
request object and processing all request phases. Within an internal
redirect, \code{req.prev} will contain a reference to a request object
from which it was redirected.

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{read}{\optional{len}}

Reads at most \var{len} bytes directly from the client, returning a
string with the data read. If the \var{len} argument is negative or
ommitted, reads all data given by the client.

This function is affected by the \code{Timeout} Apache configuration
directive. The read will be aborted and an \exception{IOError} raised
if the \code{Timeout} is reached while reading client data.

This function relies on the client providing the \code{Content-length}
header. Absense of the \code{Content-length} header will be treated as
if \code{Content-length: 0} was supplied.

Incorrect \code{Content-length} may cause the function to try to read
more data than available, which will make the function block until a
\code{Timeout} is reached.

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{readline}{\optional{len}}
Like \function{read()} but reads until end of line. 
                  
Note that in accordance with the HTTP specification, most clients will
be terminating lines with "\textbackslash r\textbackslash n" rather
than simply "\textbackslash n".

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{readlines}{\optional{sizehint}}
Reads all or up to \var{sizehint} bytes of lines using
\method{readline} and returns a list of the lines read.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{register_cleanup}{callable\optional{, data}}

Registers a cleanup. Argument \var{callable} can be any callable
object, the optional argument \var{data} can be any object (default is
\code{None}). At the very end of the request, just before the actual
request record is destroyed by Apache, \var{callable} will be called
with one argument, \var{data}.

It is OK to pass the request object as data, but keep in mind that
when the cleanup is executed, the request processing is already
complete, so doing things like writing to the client is completely
pointless. 

If errors are encountered during cleanup processing, they should be in
error log, but otherwise will not affect request processing in any
way, which makes cleanup bugs sometimes hard to spot.

If the server is shut down before the cleanup had a chance to run,
it's possible that it will not be executed.

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{sendfile}{path\optional{, offset, len}}
Sends \var{len} bytes of file \var{path} directly to the client,
starting at offset \var{offset} using the server's internal
API. \var{offset} defaults to 0, and \var{len} defaults to -1 (send
the entire file). 

This function provides the most efficient way to send a file to the
client.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{write}{string}
Writes \var{string} directly to the client, then flushes the buffer. 
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{set_content_length}{len}
Sets the value of \member{req.clength} and the "Conent-Length" header
to len. Note that after the headers have been sent out (which happens
just before the first byte of the body is written, i.e. first call to
\member{req.write()}), calling the method is meaningless.
\end{methoddesc}

\subsubsection{Request Members\label{pyapi-mprequest-mem}}

Connection Object below for details.

\section{\module{util} -- Miscellaneous Utilities\label{pyapi-util}}
\declaremodule[util]{extension}{util}
\modulesynopsis{Miscellaneous Utilities}
\moduleauthor{Gregory Trubetskoy}{grisha@modpython.org}

The \module{util} module provides a number of utilities handy to a web
application developer similar to those in the standard library
\module{cgi} module. The implementations in the \module{util} module
are much more efficient because they call directly into Apache API's
as opposed to using CGI which relies on the environment to pass
information.

The recommended way of using this module is:
\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import util
\end{verbatim}

\begin{seealso}
  \seetitle[http://CGI-Spec.Golux.Com/]
	{Common Gateway Interface RFC Project Page}
	{for detailed information on the CGI specification}
\end{seealso}

\subsection{FieldStorage class\label{pyapi-util-fstor}}

Access to form data is provided via the \class{FieldStorage}
class. This class is similar to the standard library module
\module{cgi} \class{FieldStorage}.

\begin{classdesc}{FieldStorage}{req\optional{, keep_blank_values, strict_parsing}}
This class provides uniform access to HTML form data submitted by the
client.  \var{req} is an instance of the mod_python request object.

The optional argument \var{keep_blank_values} is a flag indicating
whether blank values in URL encoded form data should be treated as
blank strings. The default is false, which means that blank values are
ignored as if they were not included.

The optional argument \var{strict_parsing} is not yet implemented.

During initialization, \class{FieldStorage} class reads all of the
data provided by the client. Since all data provided by the client is
consumed at this point, there should be no more than one
\class{FieldStorage} class instantiated per signle request, nor should
you make any attempts to read client data before or after
instantiating a \class{FieldStorage}.

The data read from the client is then parsed into separate fields and
packaged in \class{Field} objects, one per field. For HTML form inputs
of type \code{file}, a temporary file is created that can later be
accessed via the \member{file} attribute of a \class{Field} object.

The \class{FieldStorage} class has a mapping object interface, i.e. it
can be treated like a dictionary. When used as a mapping, the keys are
form input names, and the returned dictionary value can be:

\begin{itemize}
\item
An instance of \class{StringField}, containing the form input
value. This is only when there is a single value corresponding to the
input name. \class{StringField} is a subclass of \class{str} which
provides the additional \member{value} attribute for compatibility
with standard library \module{cgi} module.
\item
An instances of a \class{Field} class, if the input is a file upload.
\item
A list of \class{StringField} and/or \class{Field} objects. This is
when multiple values exist, such as for a \code{<select>} HTML form
element.
\end{itemize}

Note that unlike the standard library \module{cgi} module
\class{FieldStorage} class, a \class{Field} object is returned
\emph{only} when it is a file upload. In all other cases an instance
the return is an instance of \class{StringField}, which is a subclass
of \class{str}. This means that you do not need to use the
\member{.value} attribute to access values of fields in most cases.

In addition to standard mapping object methods, \class{FieldStorage} objects
have the following attributes:

\begin{memberdesc}{list}
This is a list of \class{Field} objects, one for each input. Multiple
inputs with the same name will have multiple elements in this list.
\end{memberdesc}

\end{classdesc}

\subsection{Field class\label{pyapi-util-fstor-fld}}

\begin{classdesc}{Field}{}
This class is used internally by \class{FieldStorage} and is not
meant to be instantiated by the user. Each instance of a \class{Field}
class represents an HTML Form input.

\class{Field} instances have the following attributes:

\begin{memberdesc}{name}
The input name.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{value}
The input value. This attribute can be used to read data from a file
upload as well, but one has to excercise caution when dealing with
large files since when accessed via \member{value}, the whole file is
read into memory.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{file}
This is a file object. For file uploads it points to a temporary file.
For simple values, it is a \class{StringIO} object, so you can read
simple string values via this attribute instead of using the \member{value}
attribute as well.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{filename}
The name of the file as provided by the client.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{type}
The content-type for this input as provided by the client.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{type_opyions}
This is what follows the actual content type in the \code{content-type}
header provided by the client, if anything. This is a dictionary.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{disposition}
The value of the first part of the \code{content-disposition} header.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{disposition_options}
The second part (if any) of the \code{content-disposition} header in
the form of a dictionary.
\end{memberdesc}

form-based file uploads}

\end{classdesc}

\subsection{Other functions\label{pyapi-util-funcs}}

\begin{funcdesc}{parse_qs}{qs\optional{, keep_blank_values, strict_parsing}}

This functnion is functionally equivalent to the standard library
\module{cgi} \function{parse_qs}, except that it is written in C and is
much faster. 

Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type
\mimetype{application/x-www-form-urlencoded}).  Data are
returned as a dictionary.  The dictionary keys are the unique query
variable names and the values are lists of values for each name.

The optional argument \var{keep_blank_values} is a flag indicating
whether blank values in URL encoded queries should be treated as blank
strings.  A true value indicates that blanks should be retained as
blank strings.  The default false value indicates that blank values
are to be ignored and treated as if they were not included.

\strong{Note:} The \var{strict_parsing} argument is not yet implemented.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{parse_qsl}{qs\optional{, keep_blank_values, strict_parsing}}

This functnion is functionally equivalent to the standard library
\module{cgi} \function{parse_qsl}, except that it is written in C and is
much faster. 

Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type
\mimetype{application/x-www-form-urlencoded}).  Data are
returned as a list of name, value pairs.

The optional argument \var{keep_blank_values} is a flag indicating
whether blank values in URL encoded queries should be treated as blank
strings.  A true value indicates that blanks should be retained as
blank strings.  The default false value indicates that blank values
are to be ignored and treated as if they were not included.

\strong{Note:} The \var{strict_parsing} argument is not yet implemented.

\end{funcdesc}
