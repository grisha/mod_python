NOTE: By far the best place to get help with installation and other
issues is the mod_python mailing list. Please take a moment to join
the mod_python mailing list by sending an e-mail with the word
"subscribe" in the subject to \email{mod_python-request@modpython.org}.

\section{Prerequisites\label{inst-prerequisites}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Python 2.2.1 or later. Earlier versions of Python will not work.
\item
Apache 2.0.40 or later (For Apache 1.3.x, use mod_python version 2.7.x).
\end{itemize}

In order to compile mod_python you will need to have the include files
for both Apache and Python, as well as the Python library installed on
your system.  If you installed Python and Apache from source, then you
already have everything needed. However, if you are using prepackaged
software (e.g. Linux Red Hat RPM, Debian, or Solaris packages from
sunsite, etc) then chances are, you have just the binaries and not the
sources on your system. Often, the Apache and Python include files and
libraries necessary to compile mod_python are part of separate
"development" package. If you are not sure whether you have all the
necessary files, either compile and install Python and Apache from
source, or refer to the documentation for your system on how to get
the development packages.

\section{Compiling\label{inst-compiling}}
\indexii{compiling}{mod_python}

There are two ways in which modules can be compiled and linked to
Apache - statically, or as a DSO (Dynamic Shared Object).

\dfn{DSO} is a more popular approach nowadays and is the recommended
one for mod_python. The module gets compiled as a shared library which
is dynamically loaded by the server at run time.

The advantage of DSO is that a module can be installed without
recompiling Apache and used as needed.  A more detailed description of
the Apache DSO mechanism is available at
\url{http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/dso.html}.

\emph{At this time only DSO is supported by mod_python.}

\dfn{Static} linking is an older approach. With dynamic linking
available on most platforms it is used less and less. The main
drawback is that it entails recompiling Apache, which in many
instances is not a favorable option.

\subsection{Running ./configure\label{inst-configure}}
\index{./configure}

The \program{./configure} script will analyze your environment and create custom
Makefiles particular to your system. Aside from all the standard
autoconf stuff, \program{./configure} does the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item
\index{apxs}
\indexii{./configure}{\longprogramopt{with-apxs}}
Finds out whether a program called \program{apxs} is available. This
program is part of the standard Apache distribution, and is necessary
for DSO compilation. If apxs cannot be found in your \envvar{PATH} or in
\filenq{/usr/local/apache/bin}, DSO compilation will not be available.

You can manually specify the location of apxs by using the
\longprogramopt{with-apxs} option, e.g.:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs 	
\end{verbatim}
%$ keep emacs happy

It is strongly recommended that you do specify this option.

%\item
%\indexii{./configure}{\longprogramopt{with-apache}}
%Checks for \longprogramopt{with-apache} option. Use this option to
%tell \program{./configure} where the Apache sources are on your
%system. The Apache sources are necessary for static compilation. If
%you do not specify this option, static compilation will not be
%available. Here is an example:

%\begin{verbatim}
%$ ./configure --with-apache=../src/apache_1.3.12 --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs
%\end{verbatim}
%%$ keep emacs happy

\item
\index{libpython.a}
Checks your Python version and attempts to figure out where
\program{libpython} is by looking at various parameters compiled into
your Python binary. By default, it will use the \program{python}
program found in your \envvar{PATH}.

\indexii{./configure}{\longprogramopt{with-python}} If the fist Python
binary in the path is not suitable or not the one desired for
mod_python, you can specify an alternative location with the
\longprogramopt{with-python} options, e.g:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ./configure --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python2.2
\end{verbatim}                      
%$ keep emacs happy

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running make\label{inst-make}}

\begin{itemize}

\item
%If possible, the \program{./configure} script will default to DSO
%compilation, otherwise, it will default to static. To stay with
%whatever \program{./configure} decided, simply run
To start the build process, simply run
\begin{verbatim}
$ make
\end{verbatim}
%$ emacs happy

%\indexii{make targets}{static}
%\indexii{make targets}{dso}

%Or, if you would like to be specific, give \program{make} a
%\programopt{dso} or \programopt{static} target:
%\begin{verbatim}
%$ make dso
%\end{verbatim}
%%$ emacs happy
%OR
%\begin{verbatim}
%$ make static
%\end{verbatim}
%%$

\end{itemize}

\section{Installing\label{inst-installing}}

\subsection{Running make install\label{inst-makeinstall}}

\begin{itemize}

\item
This part of the installation needs to be done as root. 
\begin{verbatim}
$ su
# make install
\end{verbatim}
%$ emacs happy
                      
\begin{itemize}

\item
%For DSO, this will simply copy the library into your Apache \filenq{libexec}
This will simply copy the library into your Apache \filenq{libexec}
directory, where all the other modules are.

%\item
%For static, it will copy some files into your Apache source tree.

\item
Lastly, it will install the Python libraries in \filenq{site-packages} and
compile them. 

\end{itemize} 

\indexii{make targets}{install_py_lib}
%\indexii{make targets}{install_static}
\indexii{make targets}{install_dso}
\strong{NB:} If you wish to selectively install just the Python libraries
%the static library or the DSO (which may not always require superuser
or the DSO (which may not always require superuser
privileges), you can use the following \program{make} targets:
\programopt{install_py_lib} and \programopt{install_dso}
%\programopt{install_static} and \programopt{install_dso}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuring Apache\label{inst-apacheconfig}}

\begin{itemize}

\item
If you compiled mod_python as a DSO, you will need to tell Apache to
load the module by adding the following line in the Apache
configuration file, usually called \filenq{httpd.conf} or
\filenq{apache.conf}:

\begin{verbatim}
LoadModule python_module libexec/mod_python.so
\end{verbatim}

\index{mod_python.so}
The actual path to \program{mod_python.so} may vary, but make install
should report at the very end exactly where \program{mod_python.so}
was placed and how the \code{LoadModule} directive should appear.

%\item
%If you used the static installation, you now need to recompile Apache: 

%\begin{verbatim}
%$ cd ../src/apache_1.3.12
%$ ./configure --activate-module=src/modules/python/libpython.a
%$ make
%\end{verbatim}
%%$ emacs happy
                            
%Or, if you prefer the old "Configure" style, edit
%\filenq{src/Configuration} to have

%\begin{verbatim}
%AddModule modules/python/libpython.a
%\end{verbatim}
%then run 
%\begin{verbatim}
%$ cd src
%$ ./Configure
%$ Make
%\end{verbatim}
%%$ emacs happy

\end{itemize}

\section{Testing\label{inst-testing}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Make some directory that would be visible on your web site, for
example, htdocs/test.

\item
Add the following Apache directives, which can appear in either the
main server configuration file, or \filenq{.htaccess}.  If you are
going to be using the \filenq{.htaccess} file, you will not need the
\code{<Directory>} tag below (the directory then becomes the one in
which the \filenq{.htaccess} file is located), and you will need to
make sure the \code{AllowOverride} directive applicable to this
directory has at least \code{FileInfo} specified. (The default is
\code{None}, which will not work.)
% the above has  been verified to be still true for Apache 2.0

\begin{verbatim}
<Directory /some/directory/htdocs/test> 
  AddHandler python-program .py
  PythonHandler mptest 
  PythonDebug On 
</Directory>
\end{verbatim}

(Substitute \filenq{/some/directory} above for something applicable to
your system, usually your Apache ServerRoot)

\item
At this time, if you made changes to the main configuration file, you
will need to restart Apache in order for the changes to take effect.

\item
Edit \filenq{mptest.py} file in the \filenq{htdocs/test} directory so
that is has the following lines (be careful when cutting and pasting
from your browser, you may end up with incorrect indentation and a
syntax error):

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache

def handler(req):
    req.write("Hello World!")
    return apache.OK 
\end{verbatim}

\item
Point your browser to the URL referring to the \filenq{mptest.py}; you
should see \code{"Hello World!"}. If you didn't - refer to the
troubleshooting section next.

\item
If everything worked well, move on to Chapter \ref{tutorial}, 
\citetitle[tutorial.html]{Tutorial}. 

\end{enumerate}

\section{Troubleshooting\label{inst-trouble}}

There are a few things you can try to identify the problem: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Carefully study the error output, if any. 

\item Check the server error log file, it may contain useful clues. 

\item Try running Apache from the command line in single process mode:
\begin{verbatim}
                  ./httpd -DONE_PROCESS
\end{verbatim}
This prevents it from backgrounding itself and may provide some useful
information.

\item
Ask on the mod_python list. Make sure to provide specifics such as:

\begin{itemize}

\item Mod_python version.
\item Your operating system type, name and version.
\item Your Python version, and any unusual compilation options.
\item Your Apache version.
\item Relevant parts of the Apache config, .htaccess.
\item Relevant parts of the Python code.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
