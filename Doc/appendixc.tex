\indexii{Changes from}{version 3.2.7}
  
  New Features

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      (\citetitle[http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-94]{MODPYTHON-94})
      New \code{req.is_https()} and \code{req.ssl_var_lookup()} methods.
      These communicate direct with the Apache mod_ssl module, allowing
      it to be determined if the connection is using SSL/TLS and what the
      values of internal ssl variables are.
    \item
      (\citetitle[http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-124]{MODPYTHON-124})
      New \code{req.auth_name()} and \code{req.auth_type()} methods.
      These return the values associated with the AuthName and AuthType
      directives respectively. The \code{req.ap_auth_type) has now also
      been made writable so that it can be set by an authentication
      handler.
    \item
      (\citetitle[http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-132]{MODPYTHON-132})
      New \code{req.construct_url()} method. Used to construct a fully
      qualified URI string incorporating correct scheme, server and port.
  \end{itemize}

  Improvements

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      (\citetitle[http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-77]{MODPYTHON-77})
      Third party C modules that use the simplified API for the Global
      Interpreter Lock (GIL), as described in PEP 311, can now be used. The
      only requirement is that such modules can only be used in the context
      of the \samp{main_interpreter}.
    \item
      (\citetitle[http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-125]{MODPYTHON-125})
      The \code{req.handler} attribute is now writable. This allows a handler
      executing in a phase prior to the response phase to specify which
      Apache module will be responsible for generating the content.
  \end{itemize}

\chapter{Changes from Version (3.1.4)\label{app-changes}}

\indexii{Changes from}{version 3.1.4}
  
  New Features

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      New \code{apache.register_cleanup()} method.
    \item
      New \code{apache.exists_config_define()} method.
    \item
      New file-based session manager class.
    \item
      Session cookie name can be specified.
    \item
      The maximum number of mutexes mod_python uses for session locking
      can now be specifed at compile time using 
      \code{configure --with-max-locks}.
    \item
      New a version attribute in mod_python module.
    \item
      New test handler \code{testhandler.py} has been added.
  \end{itemize}

  Improvements

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Autoreload of a module using \code{apache.import_module()} now works if
      modification time for the module is different from the file.
      Previously, the module was only reloaded if the the modification 
      time of the file was more recent. This allows for a more graceful
      reload if a file with an older modification time needs to be
      restored from backup.
    \item
      Fixed the publisher traversal security issue
    \item
      Objects hierarchy a la CherryPy can now be published.
    \item
      \code{mod_python.c} now logs reason for a 500 error
    \item
      Calls to \code{PyErr_Print} in \code{mod_python.c} are now followed by \code{fflush()}
    \item
      Using an empty value with PythonOption will unset a PythonOption key.
    \item
      \code{req.path_info} is now a read/write member.
    \item
      Improvements to FieldStorage allow uploading of large files. Uploaded
      files are now streamed to disk, not to memory.
    \item
      Path to flex is now discovered at configuration time or can be
      specifed using \code{configure --with-flex=/path/to/flex}.
    \item
      \code{sys.argv} is now initialized to \code{["mod_python"]} so that modules
      like numarray and pychart can work properly.
  \end{itemize}

  Bug Fixes

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Fixed memory leak which resulted from circular references starting 
      from the request object.

    \item
      Fixed Multiple/redundant interpreter creation problem.
    \item
      Cookie attributes  with attribute names prefixed with 
      \$ are now ignored. See Section \ref{pyapi-cookie} for more 
      information.
    \item
      Bug in setting up of config_dir from Handler directives fixed.
    \item
      mod_python.publisher will now support modules with the same name
      but in different directories

      File descriptor fd closed after \code{ap_send_fd()} in \code{req_sendfile()}
    \item
      Bug in mem_cleanup in MemorySession fixed.
    \item
      Fixed bug in \code{_apache._global_lock()} which could cause a segfault 
      if the lock index parameter is greater number of mutexes created
      at mod_python startup.
    \item
      Fixed bug where \code{local_ip} and \code{local_host} in connection object 
      were returning \code{remote_ip} and \code{remote_host} instead
    \item
      Fixed install_dso Makefile rule so it only installs the dso, not the
      python files
    \item
      Potential deadlock in psp cache handling fixed
    \item
      Fixed bug where sessions are used outside <Directory> directive.

      and \code{backslash-r} character sequences. 
    \item
      Fixed segfault bug when accessing some request object members 
      (allowed_methods, allowed_xmethods, content_languages) and some server
      object members (names, wild_names).
    \item
      Fixed request.add_handler() segfault bug when adding a handler to an empty
      handler list.
